1) gui consult patient
2) search for registered mutations
3) Update the type of the mutations also in test data for patient
4) Privacy concerns are increasing in a segment of the stakeholders, that would like to opt-out from being tracked at any time.
The system should support a citizen in this task.
More specifically, citizens should be able to modify their preferences to provide or deny consent in the tracking of geographical and sensor information.
Citizens can alter their preferences in the version of the smitteapp, which will communicate with CoronaApp by sending a message that will grant/remove permissions from the citizen.
In case the citizen has removed the consent, then the system should 1. not send geographical and sensor information from the smitteapp to the coronaApp,
and 2. Healthcare practitioners should not be able to see updated geographical/sensor information from consulted patients (in the Consult Patient use case).
To decrease false positives, the geographical/sensor information showcase in Consult Patient should then be marked with the timestamp from the last measurement.

5.1)Create all the classes necessary to execute the Consult Patient use case.
5.2)Define a set of unit tests that will be necessary to test the Patient class

6) Show that at least all the tests that are necessary to execute the standard flow for the Consult Patient flow pass.
 Provide evidence of this by including a test coverage report in your document.
